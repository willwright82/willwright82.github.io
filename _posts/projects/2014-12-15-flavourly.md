### Project Overview

**Role:** Software Engineer & Digital Designer  
**Duration:** July 2014 – February 2016  
**Technology Stack:** Django, Python, HTML5, SASS, Javascript, PostgreSQL  
**Platform:** Mobile-first, responsive eCommerce web application

Flavourly.com was launched to transform how consumers discovered high-quality craft beer and artisan foods, whilst providing small, independent producers with a national sales channel. As a core member of the design and engineering team, I redesigned and developed a scalable, mobile-first eCommerce experience (“BrewStore”) and created all supporting marketing materials to drive rapid growth and user engagement.

### The Challenge: Bridging Consumers and Small Producers

Small food and craft beer suppliers faced significant barriers to reaching consumers nationwide. Established retail channels required costly deals and logistics that were out of reach, whilst consumers lacked ways to discover unique, small-batch products not available in supermarkets. The goal was to create a single marketplace connecting these communities and enabling discovery, curation, and purchase with excellent user experience and brand storytelling.

### Market & User Insights

Research revealed:
- **Most small producers lacked any scalable route to market** and struggled with online presence and go-to-market strategies
- **Consumers wanted curated discovery experiences** with surprise, variety, and direct stories from passionate producers
- **The craft beer boom** opened opportunities for curated monthly boxes and subscription models, grounding the project in customer feedback and product ratings
