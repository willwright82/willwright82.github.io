### Project Overview

**Role:** Senior Software Engineer  
**Duration:** March 2016 - June 2017  
**Technology Stack:** Ruby on Rails, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript  
**Platform:** Mobile-first responsive web application

Clazzoo was a cloud-based booking and business management platform designed specifically for providers of recurring classes and activities. The platform aimed to solve complex operational challenges faced by small business owners in the arts, crafts, fitness, and education sectors by consolidating multiple business tools into a single, intuitive solution.

### The Challenge

Small business owners running classes, workshops, and activities faced significant operational overhead managing their businesses across multiple platforms and tools. Research revealed that typical providers needed to juggle:

- **Website hosting and domain management**
- **Separate booking systems** 
- **Payment processing platforms**
- **Email marketing tools**
- **Analytics and reporting software**
- **Manual registration and attendance tracking**

This fragmented approach resulted in:
- **High operational costs** from multiple subscriptions
- **Time-consuming administrative work**
- **Poor customer experience** across disconnected touchpoints  
- **Limited visibility** into business performance
- **Difficulty scaling** as businesses grew

The challenge was to create a unified platform that would eliminate these pain points while remaining simple enough for non-technical users to adopt quickly.

### User Research & Problem Definition

Through extensive user interviews and market analysis, we identified key user personas:

**Primary Users:**
- Arts & crafts instructors (pottery, painting, woodworking)
- Fitness professionals (yoga, pilates, personal trainers)  
- Educational service providers (tutoring, language classes)
- Community activity organisers

**Core Pain Points Discovered:**
1. **Administrative burden** – Hours spent on manual booking management
2. **Payment complexity** – Difficulty accepting online payments securely
3. **Customer communication** – No centralised way to reach participants
4. **Revenue tracking** – Poor visibility into financial performance
5. **Mobile limitations** – Existing solutions were not mobile-optimised

**User Goals:**
- Spend more time teaching, less time on admin
- Get paid reliably and on time
- Easily communicate with customers
- Understand business performance
- Accept bookings anywhere, anytime

### Conclusion

The Clazzoo project successfully demonstrated how thoughtful UX design and technical implementation could solve real business problems for small activity providers. By consolidating multiple expensive business tools into a single, intuitive platform, we created significant value for providers while improving the booking experience for their customers.

The mobile-first responsive design approach proved essential, with the majority of both provider management and customer bookings occurring on mobile devices. The simplified pricing model and transparent fee structure built trust with small business owners who had been frustrated by complex, expensive alternatives.

Key to the project's success was the user-centred design methodology, ensuring that every feature and interaction was validated against real provider and customer needs. The technical implementation balanced sophistication with simplicity, providing powerful functionality through an interface that non-technical users could adopt quickly.
