This is my first post on this new online journal. I'm not sure yet what all this will be about, so I'll just let it take it's own direction.

I've always written on paper journals in the past, but I've been feeling other people might benefit from and elaborate further on my thoughts, ideas and discoveries. That's why I've decided to give this a try.

## What you'll find here

Writing is the way I've found to organise my thoughts and easily reference back to them in the future. But I won't be *just* writing you'll find here. I'll also post:

- My thoughts on development, design and technology
- Code snippets I find to be useful to others
- Links to interesting articles/products
- Music I enjoyed listening to
- Photographs I enjoyed taking
- Books I enjoyed reading

I hope you enjoy!
