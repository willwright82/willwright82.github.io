[Nodeschool](https://nodeschool.io/) offers open source workshops that teach web software skills, which can be taken at workshops hosted worldwide (usually free) or as NPM packages which are lesson modules you run on your computer.

### Get Going

You'll only need [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and a Text editor to get started.

So for the Learn You Node module, simply enter:

`npm install -g learnyounode`

and then:

`learnyounode`

Check out all the "Workshopper" modules over at [nodeschool.io](https://nodeschool.io/).
