<p class="lead">Currently Head of UX at <a href="//emailrevenue.com" target="_blank">EmailRevenue</a> and Mentor at <a href="//www.codeyourfuture.co" target="_blank">CodeYourFuture</a>. Previously at Kindaba, Clazzoo, Flavourly, Nautilus & Apple. Husband. Dad.</p>

Will Wright is the Head of User Experience at EmailRevenue where he works to help businesses grow by improving their return on marketing spend through machine learning based data insights and decision-making. After spending more than 15 years working in design and web agencies as well as several early-stage startups, Will knows what it takes to create a truly engaging experience --- and it's not about using the design trend of the week. It's how well you connect with the people using your product and provide them with a compelling and intuitive solution.

Besides EmailRevenue Will is also a Mentor at CodeYourFuture --- a non-profit organisation supporting refugees with the dream of becoming software developers, and he enjoys playing tennis, photography, and spending time with his family.

He currently lives in Edinburgh with his wife and two sons.

## Recommendations

*“Aside from his technical skills, and problem-solving abilities which I could go on about, Will is one of the most thoughtful, open, respectful, balanced and deliberate people I know. I've had the pleasure of working with him for the past two years and have experienced first-hand his ability. He's precise with his language, and not afraid to be vulnerable in his approach to a problem. Selfishly, I'm envious of his lack of ego and ability to find pleasure in what he's doing. I have loved working with him.”*

*“Will is a craftsman, an outstanding team player, and someone who is committed to making positive impact — for his team, for the customers and for the community.”*
