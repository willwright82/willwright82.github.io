## Recommendations

*”We had a lot of comments that the UX of our product was better than the competitors, which was mainly down to Will. It's much easier to create a complicated UI than a simple one but he did a great job on making an incredibly complex product easy to use.“*
<br><small>~ Andrew Veitch, CEO at Machine Labs</small>

*“Aside from his technical skills, and problem-solving abilities which I could go on about, Will is one of the most thoughtful, open, respectful, balanced and deliberate people I know. I've had the pleasure of working with him for the past two years and have experienced first-hand his ability. He's precise with his language, and not afraid to be vulnerable in his approach to a problem. Selfishly, I'm envious of his lack of ego and ability to find pleasure in what he's doing. I have loved working with him.”*
<br><small>~ Rob Gelb, Founder at Kindaba</small>

*“Will is a craftsman, an outstanding team player, and someone who is committed to making positive impact — for his team, for the customers and for the community.”*
<br><small>~ Lizzie Brough, Co-founder at Kindaba</small>
