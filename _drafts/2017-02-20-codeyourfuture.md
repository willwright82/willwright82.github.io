I'm very proud to have joined as a Mentor while helping establish the Edinburgh operation for [CodeYourFuture](http://codeyourfuture.co/) â€“ a non-profit organisation supporting refugees with the dream of becoming developers.

Our students participate in a 6-month programme where, closely supported by experienced developers, they learn front and back end development, project-management and working culture, making them full-stack developers as they finish the course.

The programme is closely related to [HackYourFuture](http://hackyourfuture.net/) which was created in Amsterdam in 2015:

Everything is completely free, no previous experience is required and we offer all the material and equipment. All the students need to bring is their desire to learn.
